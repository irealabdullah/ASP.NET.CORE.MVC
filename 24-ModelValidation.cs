//we use this concept with forms 
// sometimes user enters invalid enteries in form --> that is why we use model validation
// pre-requsites --> model binding & create forms using tag helpers

/*what is model validation?

1) user enter invalid data which is not acceptable by database 
2) invalid age, invalid name 
3) there can be typing error or user enter wrong data wese he ;) 
4) we validate forms then we can insert data in database ;)
